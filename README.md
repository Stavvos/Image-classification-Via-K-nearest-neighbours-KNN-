This project aims to classify images of handwritten digits. The MNIST dataset of handwritten digits was used for this project, 
and the data has been split into a 80/20 train test split. A K-nearest neighbours(KNN) model has been used to classiify the images. Note that the KNN model 
works by commiting the images to memory, because of this the program can take some time to compile. 
Cross validation has been used to verify the model's performance, along with a classifcation report, and a confusion matrix.
